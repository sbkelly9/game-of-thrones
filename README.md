# Game of Thrones Fan Page

You've been tasked with building a Game of Thrones fan page, featuring your favorite characters and a short bio for each one. You can't truly honor the Queen of Dragons with a static HTML/CSS page. You need to add some interactivity!

## Prerequisites

* The DOM
* Events and event listeners

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

The starter code has been provided for you. `index.html` and `style.css` include the initial structure and styling. In `script.js`, you will find an array of objects with each character's name and bio.

1. Add a button to each character's `div` with the class `more-info`. When the user clicks the button, the name of the character prints to the console.
2. Add more functionality to the button: when clicked, the bio of the character appears beneath their image.
3. Add an input field and submit button at the top of the page. When the user types the name of a character and clicks submit, only that character remains in the browser.
4. Add another button to each character's `div` with the class `alive-or-dead`. When the user clicks the button, indicate the character is still on the show with with a green `STILL ALIVE!` under their image or that they have been killed off with a red `SORRY, YOU DEAD` under their image.

## Bonus

Add some additional features! Under the input field, create a button that, when clicked, arranges all characters in alphabetical order. Then, create another button that randomly shuffles the characters.
